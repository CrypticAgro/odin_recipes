            Ingredients
        </h4>

        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups crushed chocolate cream-filled sandwich cookies (such as OREOÂ® Cookies)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup melted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped pecans</li>
            <li>1/2 cup flaked coconut</li>
            <li>4(8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup custard powder</li>
            <li>6(1 ounce) squares semisweet chocolate</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>
            Steps
        </h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Stir together the cookie crumbs, melted butter, pecans, and coconut in a bowl until the mixture is well combined. Press into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, and refrigerate while making filling.</li>
            <li>Beat cream cheese, sugar, and custard powder in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, and beat in eggs, 1 at a time, beating each until fully incorporated before adding the next. Layer the filling over the crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, about 40 minutes. Refrigerate the cheesecake until fully cold, at least 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Melt the semisweet chocolate in a saucepan over very low heat with the cream, and stir until the mixture is smooth and well blended. Pour the chocolate mixture over the cheesecake, spread with a spatula to cover the middle layer, and refrigerate until the topping is firm, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve cold. Store leftovers in refrigerator.</li>
        </ol>
